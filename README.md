# Advertising Click Prediction Project

This project involves building a machine learning model to predict whether or not an internet user will click on a particular advertisement. The dataset used for this project contains various features related to user behavior and demographics.

## Dataset

The dataset includes the following features:

- **Daily Time Spent on Site**: The amount of time the consumer spends on the website in minutes.
- **Age**: The age of the customer in years.
- **Area Income**: The average income of the geographical area of the consumer.
- **Daily Internet Usage**: The average number of minutes the consumer spends on the internet each day.
- **Ad Topic Line**: The headline of the advertisement.
- **City**: The city of the consumer.
- **Male**: Whether or not the consumer is male (1 if male, 0 if not).
- **Country**: The country of the consumer.
- **Timestamp**: The time at which the consumer clicked on the ad or closed the window.
- **Clicked on Ad**: The target variable, where 0 indicates not clicking on the ad and 1 indicates clicking on the ad.

## Objective

The main goal of this project is to develop a machine learning model that can accurately predict whether a user will click on an advertisement based on the provided features.

## Project Files

- `advertising_data.csv`: The dataset used for training and evaluation.
- `advertising_analysis.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing data exploration, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation steps.
- `README.md`: This file, providing an overview of the project.

## Getting Started

To run the Jupyter Notebook and reproduce the results of this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required libraries by running `pip install -r requirements.txt` (if any are listed in the requirements file).
3. Open `advertising_analysis.ipynb` using Jupyter Notebook or any compatible platform.
4. Run the cells in the notebook sequentially to replicate the analysis, preprocessing, and model building.

## Conclusion

By leveraging machine learning techniques, this project aims to provide insights into the factors that influence ad clicks. Feel free to explore the notebook and adapt the code for your own analyses and experiments.
